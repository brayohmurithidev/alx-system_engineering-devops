When you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter, a series of events is triggered that allows you to access the Google website. Here's a breakdown of what happens behind the scenes:

DNS request: The first thing that happens is that your browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to resolve the domain name (google.com) into an IP address. This is necessary because computers communicate with each other using IP addresses, not domain names.

TCP/IP: Once the DNS server has provided your browser with the IP address for google.com, your browser establishes a connection to the Google server using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This involves a series of steps known as the TCP/IP handshake, which ensures that the connection between your computer and the server is secure and reliable.

Firewall: Before your request can reach the Google server, it must pass through any firewalls that are in place to protect the network from unauthorized access. A firewall is a security system that controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

HTTPS/SSL: Once your request has passed through the firewall, it is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS). This is necessary because the data being transmitted between your browser and the Google server may contain sensitive information, such as search queries or login credentials. Encrypting the data ensures that it cannot be intercepted and read by anyone other than the intended recipient.

Load-balancer: When your request reaches the Google server, it is first sent to a load balancer. This is a device that distributes incoming requests evenly across a group of servers to ensure that no single server becomes overloaded.

Web server: After passing through the load balancer, your request is forwarded to a web server. The web server is responsible for processing your request and delivering the appropriate response, which could be a web page, an image, or some other type of file.

Application server: In some cases, the web server may need to interact with an application server to fulfil your request. The application server runs the back-end processes and logic required to generate the content for the web page or perform the action that you requested.

Database: The application server may also need to retrieve data from a database in order to fulfil your request. A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a structured way, allowing for fast and efficient retrieval of specific pieces of information.

This is a high-level overview of what happens when you type https://www.google.com into your browser and press Enter. While there are many other details and technologies involved, these are the key steps that allow you to access the Google website and search the internet.
